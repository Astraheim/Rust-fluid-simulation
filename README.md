# Rust-fluid-simulation
A fluid simulation with rust for my MP2I TIPE school project. 

The goal is to code a real-time fluid simulation for a school project.
I've chosen an Eulerian simulation to allow for future expansion into an "infinite" world.
Here, I plan to use WGPU to optimize my code as much as possible.
Rayon is also being used to parallelize the calculations.
